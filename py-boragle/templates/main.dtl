				What on earth is a Boragle?
			</h3>
			<p>
				Join together 'Borg' and 'oracle' - this is what you get. A place where you ask questions that are answered by the collective wisdom of other people.

			<h3>
				How is it different from a forum or a wiki?
			</h3>
			<p>
				Boragle is more along the lines of StackOverflow - a question and answer model, except that you can create a boragle on any topic you want.
			</p>

				If this is your first time, take a look at the most recent or the most popular boragles in the lists below.
